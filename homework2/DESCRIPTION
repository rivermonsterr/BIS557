Description: This package runs a ridge regression and cross validation (though it fails all tests!). 
    It includes a series of vinettes to further supplement the answers to assignment questions.
    This package cites code from class documents, the textbook, and classmates Emma Allen and Will Duke. 
    Special thanks to Chang for all her help! 
    
    Re-installing R solved a lot of my devtool difficulties, but I'm still encountering some issues and for that I apologize.
